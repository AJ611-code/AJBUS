  <h2>How is this archive essential?
  </h2>
    <h3>The Robert G. Pflaum image collection vividly captures Pittsburgh's trolley transit system from 1958 to 1971. During this era, streetcars were a vital and efficient mode of transportation. As a young boy, Robert G. Pflaum impulsively took a trolley token from his grandparents and boarded the first streetcar he saw. He spent the entire day riding the city’s trolleys until he eventually returned home, igniting a lifelong passion for Pittsburgh's streetcar system. The archive likely chronicles the intricate infrastructure, evolving urban landscape, and vibrant daily life surrounding the streetcars. It may also document the gradual decline of streetcars, as cities across the U.S. shifted toward buses and automobiles.</a>.</h3>

  <h2>How does the past of transportation reflect on it now?
  </h2>
    <h3>The Robert G. Pflaum photograph collection offers a vivid historical record of Pittsburgh during a time when transportation played a crucial role in shaping the city. The photographs not only capture images of streetcars and other transit systems but also provide a glimpse into the daily commute and the transportation-centered lifestyle of that era. Pittsburgh's first three trolleys were motor-powered cable cars connected to continuously moving cables. By the 1920s, trolley usage surged as the city’s population doubled.</a></h3>

  <h2>WWII & Great Depression affect
  </h2>
    <h3>However, the growth of trolleys was hindered by the economic downturn of the Great Depression and the impact of World War II. After the war, returning citizens increasingly opted for personal vehicles, preferring to drive themselves rather than relying on public transportation. By the early 1950s, Pittsburgh had 33 competing transportation companies, struggling to remain profitable. One of the largest, Pittsburgh Railways Company, operated 666 streetcars.

          <h3>
          </a>The use of personal vehicles is indeed impacting public transportation, especially in cities like Pittsburgh. While public transportation has always been a crucial service, I believe we aren’t utilizing it as efficiently as we should. Before World War II, streetcars were widely popular, but after the war, the shift toward personal vehicles became dominant. People overlooked the cost-saving benefits of public transit and chose the convenience of owning a car, even though it was more expensive.
          
        Today, this trend continues, with many opting for cars despite the higher costs of fuel, maintenance, and parking. Pittsburgh Regional Transit’s chief recently warned that without increased state funding, public transit could become so underfunded that “you have to have a car to live in Pittsburgh.” This is problematic, as driving in the city is both a hassle and costly. Public transportation, such as buses and trains, offers a more affordable and efficient alternative, without the added stress of parking.

          <h3>
          </a>As personal vehicles gained popularity, public transit companies faced financial hardship. When the Port Authority proposed a streetcar system to serve the city, public sentiment leaned toward buses, which were seen as a more affordable alternative. On July 6, 1985, the last streetcars rolled through Pittsburgh, replaced by buses. As streetcars faded, the light rail T system emerged, providing a faster and higher-capacity option for traveling to Pittsburgh's most popular destinations.

      <h2>Pittsburgh Express 
      </h2>
        <h3>
        </a>In the early 1900s, Pittsburgh had robust rail connections, with the Pittsburgh Express operating several major railways between cities like Pittsburgh and New York. If we had more high-speed or nonstop train services to major cities today, it would greatly benefit the U.S. Not only would train travel be cheaper than flying or driving, but it would also encourage more sustainable and efficient transit.

        In conclusion, personal vehicles are indeed taking away from the potential benefits of public transportation. Expanding and improving public transit systems, including railways, would make travel cheaper and more efficient for everyone.

        <h2> Can the US compete with other countries with Transportation? 

        </h2>
          <h3>
          </a> As for what we should do next… is what the US always does, compare themselves to other countries. In Japan they have bullet trains that take you all around the city and they get you to places quickly. The idea of bringing back nonstop trains from Pittsburgh to major cities has to compare to the bullet trains in Japan. As the country has so much money to spend on other things they need to take into consideration for quicker and faster travel through trains. Instead of flying by plane, have another efficient way of the bullet train where it will basically be a plane but on ground. With bullet trains I bet we could be in NYC from Pittsburgh in about 2 hours. I calculated 374 miles from Pittsburgh to New York and a bullet train drives at 200 mph so it would take approximately 1 hour and 52 mins. This would be way easier than a flight from Pittsburgh to New York. Even though a flight is faster the process is way longer than it would be to just hop on a train. In conclusion increasing funding to public transportation like Pittsburgh and other cities can lead to less personal vehicle traffic, cheaper transport for the masses, and more pedestrian and environmentally friendly cities. This increase in funding and the American mindset can lead to technological advancements in public transportation, like the bullet trains in Japan, or to something the world has never seen before.
